    ## note you have built-in min and max functions in python like matlab to find the min and max ... in an array
# sort in matlab we have built-in: sort(arr1) 
in c we do not have string keyword as data type however we do in cpp:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
    char a = 'a';
    char name[] = "Alex";
    printf("%c %s", a, name); 

    return 0;
}
